### What I learned

In this project, i learned about React components (HeaderComponent, OutcomeAchieve, and OutcomeError) that are used to display different sections of a web page. The code includes features like logo display, font selection dropdown, dark mode toggle, and rendering search results or error messages. it also utilizes images and svg icons, implements state management using useState, and handles events for user interactions. The code showcases the usage of React's declarative approach and the flexibility it provides in building interactive ui components.
